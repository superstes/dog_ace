*************************
Health Protocol - Dog ACE
*************************

.. note::

    My Dog ACE has gotten very ill this year.

    We already had some close calls.. But he's a fighter!

    What this protocol should help with:

    * I want to create an open protocol of his health status, so the doctors can stay up-to-date and have detailed information about his case. As I'm located in Austria ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹, I will write it in german.

    * Add information about his case. It seems to be very uncommon. So the information could be useful for someone that encounters a similar case.

    If you have questions or information that could help/be useful - feel to reach out to me: `rene.rath@ superstes.eu`
